"Vegetation Mapping Using NDVI" 

Description :

This project is designed to provide insights into vegetation health using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculation. Users can upload TIFF images of the Red and Near-Infrared (NIR) bands, and the tool calculates NDVI, minimum NDVI, maximum NDVI, and categorizes the vegetation health. The calculated values are displayed along with visualizations like histograms and bar charts.

Features :

Upload TIFF images of Red and NIR bands.
Calculate NDVI, minimum NDVI, maximum NDVI.
Categorize vegetation health based on NDVI values.
Generate histograms and bar charts for visualization.

Getting Started :

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the interface.py script using python interface.py.
Access the web interface using the provided link.

Usage :

Open the web interface by clicking on the provided link.
Upload TIFF images of Red and NIR bands.
View calculated NDVI statistics and vegetation health category.
(Optional) Visualize NDVI values using histograms and bar charts.
Share the public link with others for easy access.
